# Browser Extensions Manager

[**Live Demo**](https://stylekyoku.github.io/browser-extensions/)

## ‚ú® Project Overview

Browser Extensions Manager is a modern web application for managing browser extensions, inspired by browser settings dashboards.

> **Note:** The design for this project was provided as a ready-made layout.
> My responsibility was to implement the frontend according to the given design using React, CSS, and best practices.

* **Browse** your extensions in a clear, card-based interface
* **Filter** extensions by status (Active/Inactive/All)
* **Toggle** extension states instantly
* **Remove** any extension from your list
* **Switch between dark and light themes** (CSS variables + React state)
* **All changes are saved** to localStorage and persist between sessions

**Project Purpose:**
Hands-on practice with React.js, state management, UI logic, adaptive CSS, and deployment to GitHub Pages.

---

## ‚ö° Tech Stack

* **Vite** ‚Äî Fast dev server and build tool
* **React.js** ‚Äî UI components and state
* **CSS** ‚Äî Flexbox, Grid, and CSS custom properties for responsive layouts and theming
* **LocalStorage** ‚Äî Persistent state saving
* **Git & GitHub** ‚Äî Version control and project hosting
* **GitHub Pages** ‚Äî Free hosting for static apps

---

## üí° Key Features

* **Pixel-perfect implementation:** The UI was built precisely to match the provided design
* **Component-based architecture:** Reusable, scalable React components (`Card`, `Logo`, etc.)
* **Persistent state:** All actions (toggle, remove) instantly update the UI and save to localStorage
* **Adaptive UI:** Responsive layout with CSS flex/grid and custom properties
* **Theming:** Dark and light modes with one click, using CSS variables and React state
* **Asset management:** SVG and image assets optimized for GitHub Pages deployment
* **Accessibility:** All interactive elements are keyboard-friendly and accessible

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Design to Code

The app was developed from a provided design, focusing on **pixel-perfect** translation into React components and CSS.

### State Management and Data Flow

* **React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)** are used to manage the extension list, filtering, theme, and synchronization with localStorage.
* **Extensions filtering** is handled by tracking filter type in state and rendering only matching cards.
* **Card toggling and removal** are handled via handler functions defined in the parent component and passed as props to child components.

### Dark/Light Theme Switching

* The current theme is stored in React state (`useState`).
* Switching themes updates a class on the `<body>`, which triggers global CSS custom properties (`--color-bg`, `--color-text`, etc.).
* All main colors and backgrounds in the CSS reference these variables, making the whole theme easily switchable and maintainable.

### Extension Activation/Deactivation

* Clicking the toggle updates the `isActive` property of the extension in the main state.
* Changes are immediately reflected in the UI and synchronized to localStorage via `useEffect`.

### Extension Removal

* Clicking "Remove" deletes the extension from the state and localStorage instantly.
* Logic is "lifted" to the parent (`App.jsx`) for clean, scalable data management.

### Backend-Ready Logic

* The code is structured so that local changes (toggle, remove) can easily be swapped for API requests.
* For example, you can update the `handleRemove` function as follows for backend integration:

  ```js
  // Example for backend integration:
  const handleRemove = async (name) => {
    await fetch(`/api/extensions/${name}`, { method: 'DELETE' });
    setExtensions(prev => prev.filter(item => item.name !== name));
  }
  ```
* This demonstrates real-world readiness for integrating with RESTful or GraphQL APIs.

### Adaptive, Responsive Layout

* The layout uses CSS Grid and Flexbox with `gap` and `auto-fit` for a responsive experience on all devices.
* No layout bugs on mobile/tablet/desktop: all breakpoints are handled using modern CSS, sometimes without media queries.

### Asset & Deployment Handling

* All images and SVGs are placed in the `public/assets/images` folder for reliable loading on GitHub Pages.
* The `homepage` field in `package.json` is configured for correct asset paths after deployment.

## üöÄ Why This Project Matters

* **Professional approach:** Accurately translated design specs into a real, working UI.
* **UX-first thinking:** Every UI/UX solution reflects real-world scenarios and best practices.
* **End-to-end implementation:** From architecture and state management to deployment and asset handling.
* **Modern stack:** Uses current best practices (Vite, hooks, CSS variables, clean Git workflow).
* **Production-ready:** Handles GitHub Pages deployment details and static asset paths.
* **Learning-oriented:** Demonstrates my ability to quickly learn, adapt, and deliver quality results.

## üßë‚Äçüíª What This Shows About My Skills

* Proficient in **React state, hooks, props, and component communication**
* Able to deliver **pixel-perfect front-end implementations from design files**
* Understand **real-world frontend-backend data flow** and am ready for backend/API integration
* Write **maintainable, scalable, and adaptive CSS** with variables and modern layout techniques
* Confident in **deploying and debugging on production-like static hosting**
* Consistent with **code readability, best practices, and separation of concerns**
